1. <%= pdfbadge %> Read: [Achieve product Market Fit](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html). After reading it on your own, get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together. Based on the reading discuss and debate the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)" and how it applies to your project. The purpose of this exercise is for you to better understand the value proposition your product is going after, as well as the customer segment that you are going after. <%= team_deliverable "Write up the results of the discussion about your overall value proposition and customer segment, in outline form. Submit to Latte as a pdf." %>
1.  <%= pdfbadge %> An entrepreneur has to learn to think strategically, analytically and carefully when evaluating what to do, how to do it, and what to do next. Read [Delivery Startups are Back like it's 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html). Think about the idea of a delivery startup on campus. What might be some of the advantages of targeting college students? What are characteristics of them as a customer base which would make it hard for a fedex or amazon to deliver to them? What are some of their needs which might be different and hard to meet by a general business? How would you test some of these questions and assumptions? What kinds of products might be amenable? Is there room to capitalize on the slowness of the mailroom? What products, services, customers, campuses, geographies, and any other characteristics might be relevant? Is this a worthwhile idea to pursue? We will have a class discussion on this. Be prepared.
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** Reflect on your personal reactions and feelings on the Lean Startup technique. Please don't simply parrot what's in the book. Pause to think about what it has been like to apply it so far. What are some key learnings? How would you explain it to a friend? What parts of it don't you think are valuable? <%= deliverable "Post with your personal reflection" %>
1. **Teams**: Meet for at least 2 hours per week! Continue working on Stage 2 of <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %>. Continue refining your product, getting more feedback and supporting information and preparing your <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>
