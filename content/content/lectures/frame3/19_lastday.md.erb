#### Course evals
* Please take a moment NOW to do your course evals!
* Final deliverables are due at 11:59:00pm Dec 8th. I realize that the presentation slides might need to change as you practice, so they may be resubmitted if you want to. The deadline for resubmission is midnight the day before presentation day.

#### Random Discussions and delicious treats!

* Read this article before giving your presentation: [How to nail a presentation](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/10/20/how-to-nail-a-presentation-to-a-crowd/)

* Remember your <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>!

* How is the preparation going for the final showcase?

* Who wants to present their current presentation to the class for feedback?

#### THANKS! To everyone and especially our TAs!
