We are really lucky to have Dulcie Madden the co-founder and CEO of Rest Devices, a startup that builds personalized AI-driven coaching products for families and healthcare consumers. In partnership with Johnson & Johnson, Rest Devices launched Nod, an app-based software platform delivering customized sleep coaching to parents, now used in more than 40 countries. Rest has also launched and scaled multiple groundbreaking consumer hardware products for monitoring sleep, including the Mimo Baby Sleep Monitor.

Dulcie has a BS in Biology from Georgetown University and half an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management. She lives in Boston with her husband and their two young children.
