1. **Spreadsheets:** Read and learn how to design good spreadsheets. Even if you think you know how, read both of these: [How to use a spreadsheet to create a simple budget](http://geekgirls.com/2013/08/spreadsheet-budget/) and [Good Spreadsheet Design](http://geekgirls.com/2013/08/good-spreadsheet-design/). Do all the examples in Google Sheets. Show off your knowledge of two important ideas in spreadsheets. Ceate a small but coherent example showing off the use of absolute and relative references, as well the use of the =VLOOKUP function. <%= deliverable "Submit the url of the google sheet with your work. Don't forget to make it accessible by all" %>

##### Continuing work
* **Work on Stage 3**: Look at the <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_term_project_outline %>. Now we are into the business issues. You will have talked and discussed this along the way. Who is your competition? How will you be different? How are you going to price and what is your financial analysis look like? And how will you plan to drive growth?

##### Interesting, but not required reading
* [Paul Graham on Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)
* [Your LTV Math is Wrong](http://bostonvcblog.typepad.com/vc/2015/10/your-ltv-math-is-wrong.html)

##### Discussion
* Should "Key Takeaways" be at the front or end of these?
* How do you use this content? Do you read it from the screen? How about after the lecture?
