### Leadership

#### Credits
* This brief guide to leadership is strongly based on the book: [Becoming a Technical Leader](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Problem-Solving-Approach/dp/0932633021)

#### Questions to ponder and discuss
* Are leaders really as stupid as they sometimes behave?
* Can I be a leader without becoming like those other people?
* How can I be a leader and keep up my technical skills at the same time?
* Is there a place for a leader in high-tech society who never had any technical skills to begin with?
* How much of my technical expertise do I need to acriﬁce?
* What will I get in return?
* If I’m a leader, will I have to boss people around?
* Can I learn leadership from reading books?
* What else can I do to learn?
* Why do people see me as a leader, when I don’t feel that way?
* Why don’t people see me as a leader, when I feel quite capable?
* What if I don’t want to assume leadership responsibility?
* What is leadership, anyway?

#### Can you be a manager?
* But...
  * "I'm not a manager!"
  * "I'm not a leader type"
  * "I'll lose my technical skills"
  * "I dont want that much power"
* How did I (Pito) learn to be a leader?
  * Who says you are?
  * On the ground experience
  * Reading lots of things. I recommend [Becoming a Technical Leader](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Problem-Solving-Approach/dp/0932633021)



#### What is leadership?
* Different, much more than, management
* Except in a few contexts (military?) the leader can't `make` people do anything
* Leadership: "of what?" and "to what end?"
  * Of what: the team, the available resources, the stake holders
  * To what end: the goal, the problem, the mission, the objective
* M-O-I model

##### Ideas / Imagination / Innovation
* Figure out and understand the essence of the goal
* Seek and communicate clarifications as needed
* See the bigger picture, put the goal into context
* Contribute valuable ideas to the team
* Articulate or re-articulate this 

##### Motivation
* Help the team embrace the goal
* Be in their shoes, and try to undertstand what makes them tick
* Re-articulate the goal over and over again
* Each member should understand why the goal is important and how their bit of it matters

#####  Organization
* Grasp the overall purpose or mission
* Grasp the capabilities of you and your team
* Develop a plan of attach, an approach to getting to the goal
* Track or monitor progress
* Be alert to changes in priority, objectives

#### Communication

#### Failure
