1. <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapter 8. This chapter is about pivoting (or not!) Please answer the following warmup questions:
  * Often the term "runway" is used in startup financing to refer to how many months there are to go before the money runs out. Eric Ries says "A startup's runway is the number of pivots it can still make." What is he trying to get at? Is there a real difference in his statement? What is he reminding us of?
  * If several of your hypotheses are invalidated through experiments, does that mean that you have to Pivot? Explain.
  * It's been said (by me among others) that an MVP is neither minimum, viable nor a product. Can you explain why that might be a valid statement, or not?
  * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
  * <%= deliverable "Answer the Warmup questions in Latte" %>.
1. **Read:** and prepare for a class discussion
	* [Don't let the Minimum overcome the Viable](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/05/dont_let_the_minimum_win_over.html).
	* [Pivoting when using Lean Startup](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/07/pivoting-product-development)
  * [Eric Ries about his latest thoughts on MVP](https://medium.com/galleys/the-minimum-viable-product-a-primer-3d9a76dd5213)
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **New Iteration**: We are now starting weekly iterations.
  * In general you and your team will decide what to do for each iteration using Agile techniques and trello to coordinate your work. Each week the team should write a brief iteration retrospective, summarizing in bullet form how the iteration went, what was achieved, where you are stuck or confused **and email it to your TA partner**. Refer to [Scrum Meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum) for insight into the three questions. Also store it in Latte.
  * Update this [Term Project Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/14YSklNErSlD5ZeAdSjXK7VOSWpV66Y0L-OMagXouj0E/edit?usp=sharing). Include: Your trello URL, your Google Drive URL, the URL to your draft term project report, and the time/place for your weekly meeting. We will fill in the name of your TA partner.


#### Discussions
* Quick review of homeworks, participation, and marks. See <%= link_to_topic :homework %>
* Discuss question from readings.

#### Discuss weekly iterations:
Three questions: Each team spend a few minutes in discussing your "three questions" and select one person to report out to the class.

#### Pivots
<%= include_topic :pivot_types %>

#### Next Class
