1. <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapter 8. This chapter is about pivoting (or not!) Please answer the following warmup questions:
    * Often the term "runway" is used in startup financing to refer to how many months there are to go before the money runs out. Eric Ries says "A startup's runway is the number of pivots it can still make." What is he trying to get at? Is there a real difference in his statement? What is he reminding us of?
    * If several of your hypotheses are invalidated through experiments, does that mean that you have to Pivot? Explain.
    * It's been said (by me among others) that an MVP is neither minimum, viable nor a product. Can you explain why that might be a valid statement, or not?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these questions in a pdf to latte" %>.
  1. **Teams**: Continue working together and independently on your product in weekly iterations. Review <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %> for suggestions. You are working on Stage 1, deliverables due on Oct 24.

#### Discussions
* Quick review of homeworks, participation, and marks. See <%= link_to_topic :homework %>
* Discuss question from readings.

#### Discuss weekly iterations
* You need to have decided on a time and place for your weekly meeting, and add that to the term project dashboard.
* You need to coordinate with TA partner to make sure he or she can participate, at least in part of the meeting
* Realize that the weekly meetings are for coordiantion and alone are defintely not sufficient
* Like any formal meeting, one team member needs to summarize the meeting and the plan for the coming week.
* All these summaries go into a single Meeting Summary document, that you link to the [Term Project Dashboard](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/wiki/view.php?id=604800)
