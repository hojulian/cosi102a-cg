<%= homework_hdr %>

1. **Read:** Read and come with questions about how the term projects will work.
	* <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %>
	* <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Shark Tank:** Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Submit some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Term Project Ideation:** Work with one other student to develop a more detailed product description. **You** choose a single partner and spend 1+ hours talking and writing. Choose your favorite idea from [our list of ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055) develop it further and write it up with your partner. (You're welcome to add a new idea to the list now too.) Your write up should not be longer than 1 page. Each student of the pair will submit the same pdf and will get the same mark for the writeup. <%= deliverable "More detailed write up of your favorite (so far) term product idea" %>

 	Points to cover in the product writeup:

  * Product name and a tweet length summary of product
  * Description of the product, the vision, what it does
  * What kind of customer(s) is it for?
  * What "job" does it do for a user or customer(s)?
  * Why you think it's cool


#### Discussion
* Open discussion on working on projects in teams
* Clarifying what it means to be on a project
* Team dynamics is hard. Alignment is hard
* Start by talking over what product your team wants to pick
* What is your lattitude around the basic vision?

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
