1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Term Project Ideation:** Work with one other student to develop a more detailed product description. **You** choose a single partner and spend 1+ hours talking and writing. You can expand on an idea on our [our list of ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=597311), or create a brand new one. Either way,  develop it further and write it up with your partner. (You're welcome to add a new idea to the list now too.) Your write up should not be longer than 1 page. Each student of the pair will submit the same pdf and will get the same mark for the writeup. Points to cover in the product writeup:
    * Product name and one line summary of product
    * Description of the product, the vision, the features
    * What kind of customer(s) is it for? What "job" does it do for a user or customer(s)?
    * Why you think it's cool
    * <%= deliverable "More detailed write up of your favorite (so far) term product idea" %>
