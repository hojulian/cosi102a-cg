<%= homework_hdr %>

1. **Read:** Read and come with questions about how the term projects will work.
	* <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %>
	* <%= link_to_topic :cs165a_final_deliverables %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Shark Tank:** Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Submit some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?" %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **PILOT project team and self assessment**: Write a self and team assessment about your experience during the Pilot Project, touching on: What each person on your team, including yourself, did on the team, took responsibility for; give each one a grade, including yourself, and explain why you think they should get that grade. You might check the <%= link_to_background :grading %> under "Contribution to the team" to get an idea what to think about. Your post will be confidential and supplement the instructors' view on your contribution to the team during the pilot phase. Make sure you mention the team members names! <%= deliverable "Posted on latte as a pdf" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Term Project Ideation:** Work with one other student to develop a more detailed product description. **You** choose a single partner and spend 2 hours talking and writing. Choose your favorite idea from [our list of ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055) develop it further and write it up with your partner. (You're welcome to add a new idea to the list now too.) Your write up should not be longer than 1 page. Each student of the pair will submit the same pdf and will get the same mark for the writeup. <%= deliverable "More detailed write up of your favorite (so far) term product idea" %>

 	Points to cover in the product writeup:

  * Product name and a tweet length summary of product
  * Description of the product, the vision, what it does
  * What kind of customer(s) is it for?
  * What "job" does it do for a user or customer(s)?
  * Why you think it's cool


#### Discussion
* Open discussion on working on projects in teams
* Clarifying what it means to be on a project
* Team dynamics is hard. Alignment is hard
* Start by talking over what product your team wants to pick
* What is your lattitude around the basic vision?

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
