How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?" %>

#### Teams have been formed
* We have 18 or so excellent product ideas (incuding a few good ones that didn't make it)
* We surveyed all students for their first and second choice.
* Our goal was to maximize happiness among all the students (assuming getting your first choice contributes to happiness etc.)
* I think solving this is an np complete problem :)
* Maybe someone wants to do a computer science independent study to computerize the process
* But for now, we spent around 7 person hours doing analysis in 3 different spreadsheets, over at least 3 separate meetings

##### Results:
* 3 students never responded to what their first and second choices were!
* 27 students got their first choice
* 13 students got their second choice
* Only 4 students didn't get their first or second choice :(
* We created 11 teams of 4 students each and one with 11

##### A few reminders about our process
* Ideas are cheap.
  * Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.
  * The idea as written up is just a jumping off point. Based on the team and going out of the building, you will adjust it a little or a lot even.
* All team members come in equal.
  * Everyone has to agree on how the team will be run.
  * I have not assigned a manager.
  * If the team wishes to nominate one (which is not a bad idea) do so at the second or maybe third meeting.
* Alignment
  * This is  very important concept.
  * I will harp on it a lot.
  * Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
  * This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
  * The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.


#### Review of Lean Startup Concepts (so far)
Bear with me. I am going to go through each one to reinforce, review and clarify.
