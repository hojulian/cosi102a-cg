<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapter 9. Think and answer the following warmup questions:
    * **Batch Sizes:** Why are small batch sizes said to be superior in planning? What exactly is a batch? Can you think of an example not in the book where batch sizes can be small or large? Does the book match your intuition?
    * **Pull vs. Push:** Imagine that you lived in an apartment with several other people, and it was your job to make sure you never ran out of milk or toilet paper (...or beer?). Describe how you would go about this if you were employing a pull model vs. a push model. What are the tradeoffs that you will need to make? What resources (time, money, space, transportation) would affect your choice? What are the pros and cons when using pull or push in this scenario?
    * **Check for understanding**: What key topics from this content are you confused about and would like further explanation? And if it's all pretty clear, then what are a few of the key learnings or insights presented in this material? p.s. Make sure you indicate clearly for each point whether you are clear on it or are still confused about it!
    * <%= deliverable "You're responses to above questions as a pdf" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Estimation:** Read [What do you mean you need more time?](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/10/what-do-you-mean-you-need-more-time/). The lawn at my house is 10m x 20m. Estimate how much time it would take you to mow it, and justify your estimate carefully. Estimate how much you would charge me to do it once a week. Email me personally if you need any clarification. <%= deliverable "Write up your specific overall charge, and your overall time estimate in hours. Include a detailed justification of the time estimate and charge. How exactly did you arrive at thos figures? Write up as a pdf, submit to latte." %>
1. <%= teambadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

##### Ongoing Work
* <%= teambadge %> Teams, Continue working together and independently on your product in weekly iterations. You should be meeting at least once a week as a team. Remember to invite your TA Partner. Review <%= link_to_section :term, :term_project_outline %> for suggestions. You are working on Stage 1, deliverables due on Oct 18.

#### Post-it note exercise

* **Top Results**
    1. Less homework — you’re a great professor and I love the stories (9) - not every class
    1. Invite other professors (cs) to talk about their entrepreneur experience (6)
    1. More group discussions in class (5)
    1. More case studies on other companies, or real life situations (4)
    1. Have the TAs more involved in the group projects (OH available) (3)
    1. More hands on classes (2)

* **Already planned**
    1. More checkins - by Pito or TAs
    1. Topic on how to look at startups from an investors point of view
    1. More practice pitches instead of just waiting till the final presentation (should have practiced the pilot project)
    1. Some way that students that don’t participate in group work get penalized
    1. Go over more ways to do hypothesis testing

* **Things I can act on:**
    1. Less focus on lean startup (author can be redundant), condense into section ideas
    1. Expand on what the book said, instead of just going over it
    1. More discussions on the actual technical implementations of our project ideas
    1. Meet with Pito early during the project to discuss ideas since you have a lot of experience
    1. Encourage more complicated MVPs like programming
    1. Improve procedure for selecting term project — maybe vote online

* **Items I don't agree with**
    1. Course should be a year
    1. Longer more detailed time for pilot projects
