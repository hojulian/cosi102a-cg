  * This is an individual assignment. Based on this reading, write up one or two original ideas for MVPs that you think would be really effective for your product. Preferably not a google form. Write it up in a way that you could acually implement it over the coming weekend. Make sure you tie it to a hypothesis that you and your team have prioritized. <%= deliverable "Brief writeup of your proposed MVP as a pdf submitted to Latte" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Review**: Look at this cool site that Emad found: [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses). Poke around it and read 3 projects that interest you. I would like you to tell me what 3 you picked, give a one or two sentence summary of what the product is, and tell me one idea you got from reading it that you might be able to use. <%= deliverable "Write up answering those questions." %>
