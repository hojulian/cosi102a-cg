<%= homework_hdr %>
1. <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> Read: "The Lean Startup", Chapter 9. Think and answer the following warmup questions:
  * **Batch Sizes:** Why are small batch sizes said to be superior in planning? What exactly is a batch? Can you think of an example not in the book where batch sizes can be small or large? Does the book match your intuition?
  * **Pull vs. Push:** Imagine that you lived in an apartment with several other people, and it was your job to make sure you never ran out of milk or toilet paper (...or beer?). Describe how you would go about this if you were employing a pull model vs. a push model. What are the tradeoffs that you will need to make? What resources (time, money, space, transportation) would affect your choice? What are the pros and cons when using pull or push in this scenario?
  * **Check for understanding**: What key topics from this content are you confused about and would like further explanation? And if it's all pretty clear, then what are a few of the key learnings or insights presented in this material? p.s. Make sure you indicate clearly for each point whether you are clear on it or are still confused about it!

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Estimation:** Read [What do you mean you need more time?](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/10/what-do-you-mean-you-need-more-time/). The lawn at my house is 10m x 20m. Estimate how much time it would take you to do, and justify your estimate carefully. Estimate how much you would charge me to do it once a week. Email me personally if you need any clarification. <%= deliverable "Write up your specific overall charge, and your overall time estimate in hours. Include a detailed justification of the time estimate and charge. How exactly did you arrive at thos figures? Write up as a pdf, submit to latte." %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Team Alignment** Meet for at least 2 hours, face to face with your team and come up with your team's product vision with the following elements. Notice that for this exercise to discuss with the team members and articulate them in a fairly precise way what you all believe will work. I realize that they are so far not tested. The important thing at this point is that all team members engage and understand and agree with the vision.
  * **Product Vision**: Your current vision of the product. Make it descriptive, not salesy. Remember the reader is not inside your head they will need to have it explained.
  * **Problems that it solves**: Continue your explanation by explicitly stating the list of 1 or 2 or 3 real world user problems that it solves. Make it pass the common sense tests. These should not be tiny silly problems but should be recognizable by the target users. Distinguish between problems you solve and pains you remove.
  * **Who is/are the customer/s**: Describe groups of users or customers in a way that keeps in mind how you might reach them. If your customers are "Higher Ed Students who are having trouble finishing their homework on time". How would you find them to talk to them and dig deeper? Also remember that your vision might include two disjoint sets of users or customers.
