#### Notes

Today we will analyze the case -  Microsoft: Positioning the Tablet PC. Please read, analyze and develop a plan of action for Microsoft for the launch of the Tablet PC. Below are some questions to help guide your thinking. Please also consider the rubrics we discussed in our last meeting. Finally, don’t worry about what did or did not happen. Situate yourself at the time of the case with the facts known at that moment. The purpose of a case study is not to accurately predict what a company did, but to understand the important strategic options, be able to analyze each fully, and to develop a plan of action that you can defend with rigorous analysis and logical, persuasive arguments.

1.	How should Microsoft position the Tablet PC -  as a radical innovation that will dramatically change consumers’ relationships with their PCs, or as a high-end laptop? Why?
2.	Who should the initial target market for the Tablet PC be?
3.	Imagine that you are Bert Keely. How do you convince consumers to adopt your vision of a world in which “the personal computer becomes truly personal?” More specifically, you know that there are going to be obstacles to consumer adoption of this product. What do you think the biggest obstacles are going to be? How do you plan to overcome those obstacles?
4.	Bill Gates’ prediction is that within 5 years, the Tablet PC will be the most popular form of PC sold in America (case pg 1). Why is Gates so excited about this product? What value does it create for users? What do you think the “killer app” for this product is going to be?
5.	The Tablet PC is not a single technology; rather, it pulls together a number of innovations, including ClearType, RichInk (the “ink as ink” idea), handwriting recognition, voice recognition, wireless capability, a new software utility (Windows Journal), digital content (eBooks), and so on. How important are these various innovations? Do these technologies have to be perfect or will consumers accept something less than perfect?
