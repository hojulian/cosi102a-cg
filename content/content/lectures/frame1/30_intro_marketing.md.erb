* **Read**: The [attached zip file contains four (brief) documents](/content/topics/documents/marketingreadings.zip/) that you need to read before this class. 

##### Interesting optional reading
* You can find both of these as optional (and non-free) readings in this [Cosi102a Coursepack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/671566).: "Marketing Reading: Framework for Marketing Strategy Formation" and "Note on Low-Tech Marketing Math". They are optional but very worth while.

##### Ongoing Work
* <%= teambadge %> Teams, Continue working together and independently on your product in weekly iterations. You should be meeting at least once a week as a team. Remember to invite your TA Partner. Review <%= link_to_section :term, :term_project_outline %> for suggestions. You are working on Stage 1, deliverables due on Oct 17.
