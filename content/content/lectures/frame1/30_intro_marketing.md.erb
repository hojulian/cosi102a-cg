##### Interesting optional reading
* You can find both of these as optional (and non-free) readings in this [Cosi102a Coursepack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/671566).: "Marketing Reading: Framework for Marketing Strategy Formation" and "Note on Low-Tech Marketing Math". They are optional but very worth while.
