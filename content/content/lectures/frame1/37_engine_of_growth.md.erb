#### Your feedback on Post-it Notes

##### You liked: 
* Energetic Lectures
* Very interesting, even readings, although they are a bit long
* Youre doing great
* Lean Startup is a good book

##### Room for improvement
* **Case Studies**: You would like more more case studies (6) and guest speakers (5) (e.g. real startups)
* **Book:** You like the book but some people feel there is too much book discussion (3), too many reading assignments (3); but on the other hands some of you want more book discussion (3) and more class discussions in general (3), but you dont like the cold calling (2)
* **Lecturing**: You would like less lecturing (2) and instead have more hands-on activities in class (6)
* **Group work:** Some people want more group work in class (2) or less group work in class (2)
* **Projects**: You would like more talk about projects in class, about how to do an mvp (2), how to be effective in a team, and you wish you had more guidance on the pilot projects.

##### Actions
* I will try to have less lecturing and more in class activities
* You just had several guest speakers in a row, more are coming
* I am thinking of starting each class with a short discussion about a product, or product idea, or one of the term projects, what do you think?

### And now, on with the normal schedule
