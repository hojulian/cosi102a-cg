1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Outgoing email MVP:** One kind of MVP is a simple email. The purpose of this exercise is to practice pitching your product and asking a random person to help you with your startup. You are asking whether the person would be willing to spend 20 minutes talking to you about a product. Your email needs to convince the person to be interested in your product, and get them to say yes. Of course that means the email needs to be clear, persuasive, businesslike and relatively brief. Conceptually you might be sending the email to a LinkedIn Groups, Quora postings, other special interest mailing lists. Each team member separately, identify a specific group that could have useful information on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email that you would send to them expecting an answer. <%= deliverable "Email text, explanation of what hypotheses it is testing, and where you would send it for maximum effect, and why." %>
