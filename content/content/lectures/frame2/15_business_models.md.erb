1.<%= pdfbadge %> **Teams**: Watch this brief video about the Business Model Canvas (by Alexander Osterwalter)
  <iframe width="460" height="259" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QoAOzMTLP5s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  * This assignment REQUIRES coordination among the team members even though it's an individual deliverable. Believe me, it works better and quicker if you do it together face to face. But everyone will submit a separate assignment.
  * Watch the video and download and look at the [Business Model Canvas Poster](https://canvanizer.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf). Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work. Osterwalter and his colleagues organize the business model space into nine **building blocks** which suggest a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them.
  * Divide up the Business Model Canvas 'building blocks' among your team. There are nine such blocks on the poster. **Each team member must do some more web research on the Osterwalter's Business Model Canvas to supplement the small summary in the video**. Together or separately discuss and brainstorm what goes into each block.
  * <%= deliverable 'Your thoughts about "your block" as it pertains to your teams term project, and response to key questions posed by the Business Model Canvas with respect to your block and your term project, as a pdf. Include your name and assignment' %>

##### Ongoing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 13. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.

#### Formal Project Review Checkpoints
* This will be graded. 
* Starting this next wed for 1 week
* For fairness, if you dont reserve a block or miss the 1 week window, 20 points will be deducted
* Unless excused, all team members need to be present
* Use this link to reserve a 45 minute spot: [Reservation for 165 FPRC](https://calendly.com/pitosalas/165)
* TAs are meeting with you right now to help you prepare. Make sure you find the time
* Prepare a presentation (maybe 10-15 minutes) which I will ask you to actually present!
* This is not the same presentation you will give at the end (see <%= link_to_section :term, :final_presentation %>), because that one will have more data in it and will be shorter. In this one I would like some more detail.

##### Suggestions for what to prepare
* Project summary
* What is it?
  * What problem does it solve?
  * How big a problem is this?

  * Why do you believe this?
* How will it make money?

  * Why do you believe this?
