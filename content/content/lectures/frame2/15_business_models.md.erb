  * This assignment REQUIRES coordination among the team members even though it's an individual deliverable. Believe me, it works better and quicker if you do it together face to face. But everyone will submit a separate assignment.
  * Watch the video and download and look at the [Business Model Canvas Poster](https://canvanizer.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf). Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. Think about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work. Osterwalter and his colleagues organize the business model space into nine **building blocks** which suggest a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them.
  * Divide up the Business Model Canvas 'building blocks' among your team. There are nine such blocks on the poster. **Each team member must do some more web research on the Osterwalter's Business Model Canvas to supplement the small summary in the video**. Together or separately discuss and brainstorm what goes into each block.
  * <%= deliverable 'Your thoughts about "your block" as it pertains to your teams term project, and response to key questions posed by the Business Model Canvas with respect to your block and your term project, as a pdf. Include your name and assignment' %>
