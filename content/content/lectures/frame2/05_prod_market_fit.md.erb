1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Teams** Read: [Achieve product Market Fit](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html). After reading it on your own, get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together. Really read the article and try to understand the point. You will find its insights very very valuable. Based on the reading discuss and debate the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)" and how it applies to your project specifically. Next actually fill in a copy of the canvas as a team. Discuss each box and what would go in it. The purpose of this exercise is for you to better understand the value proposition your product is going after, as well as the customer segment that you are going after.  <%= team_deliverable "Write up the results of the discussion about your overall value proposition and customer segment. Also include your 'filled in' vp canvas. Dont worry about making it fancy just include the info. Submit to Latte as a pdf." %>

##### Continuing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 13. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.
