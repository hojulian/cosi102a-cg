#### Key Points that Duclie Will cover

* Entrepreneurship is like swimming (or surfing): always swim with a buddy [i.e. cofounders are highly helpful for a zillion reasons, most of all survival]
* You can recover from just about anything 
* People are more important than anything else, particularly early team members
