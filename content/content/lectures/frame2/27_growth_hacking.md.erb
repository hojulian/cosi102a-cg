1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Pirate Metrics and Growth Hacking:** Growth Hacking is a 'new profession'. The function is to develop analytical tools and techniques, and a methodology to connect spending on growth with actual results. It's closely related to 'pirate metrics' which is a funny expression cointed to describe a very effective approach. The goal of this work is to introduce you to the fundamental ideas and proponents of it, and ask you to think critically about how these techniques might come into play for your projects:
    * Read the attached PDF of a blog post: <a href="../growthhacking.pdf">Growth Hacking</a>.
    * View this five-minute video by [Dave McClure on "Pirate Metrics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjgfW0BIrw), so you understand one of the key ways we measure the components of success: "Startup Metrics for Pirates".
    * Read and understand what is meant by Growth Hacking. There are lots of sources on the web. Here are two: [The Rise of the Growth Hacker](http://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/).

    <%= deliverable "This is not obvious: it will require thinking and clear writing. Using the articles or any other source, please explain how Growth Hacking might apply to your team's product" %>

1. <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Think and write one-two sentence answers to these three questions with respect to your product. I would like this to be the result of a real discussion among the team members who should be prepared to present them in class. Here are the questions:
    1. What “problem” are you solving? (in 15 secs or less)
    1. Whose “problem” are you solving? (describe your target user with fewer than 6 attributes)
    1. How are you going to prove whether you are solving this problem for those people? (what “single” thing should or would you do to demonnstrate this, say over the next 6-9 months?)
    
    <%= team_deliverable "Your answers to the three questions" %>

##### Continuing work
* **Work on Stage 3**: Should be completed on December 3. Look at the <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_term_project_outline %>. Now we are into the business issues. You will have talked and discussed this along the way. Who is your competition? How will you be different? How are you going to price and what is your financial analysis look like? And how will you plan to drive growth?

##### Interesting, but not mandatory reading
1. **Pirate Metrics** The seminal "Pirate Metrics" presentation by Dave McClure. [Video of Pirate Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-fiwdlxAs), and the corresponding slide deck: [Startup Metrics for Pirates](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).

#### Discussion: Formal Project Review Checkpoints
* This will be graded. 
* Starting this next wed for 1 week
* For fairness, if you dont reserve a block or miss the 1 week window, 20 points will be deducted
* Unless excused, all team members need to be present
* Use this link to reserve a 45 minute spot: [Reservation for 165 FPRC](https://calendly.com/pitosalas/165)
* TAs are meeting with you right now to help you prepare. Make sure you find the time
* Prepare a presentation (maybe 10-15 minutes) which I will ask you to actually present!
* This is not the same presentation you will give at the end (see <%= link_to_section :term, :final_presentation %>), because that one will have more data in it and will be shorter. In this one I would like some more detail.

##### Suggestions for what to prepare
* Project summary
* What is it?
  * What problem does it solve?
  * How big a problem is this?
  * Why do you believe this?
* Who is it for?
  * How specific can you be
  * How will you reach or market to this segment?
  * Why do you believe this?
* How will it make money?
  * What pricing have you tested so far
  * Can you say whether that wil be a profitable business?
  * Why do you believe this?
* What are the hypotheses and how did you test them
  * MVPs
  * Pivots
* Show and tell: 
  * data, diagrams, mvps, spreadsheets, etc.
  * Mockups, Web sites, Surveys, Results etc.

#### Pirate Metrics
* AARRR!
* Customer Lifecycle
* Where did they come from?
* Stages
  * Acquisition - users come to the site from some channel
  * Activation - users "enjoy" first visit, have a good experiecne
  * Retention - users come back, visit again
  * Referral - users like the products enough to refer others
  * Revenue - users conduct some monetization action
* What are users?
* What about two or three sided markets?
* Conversion: Getting a specific user from one to the next stage
* See: [Example Converstion Metrics](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/1HCOLcjFBO5sjhuwd1iICwGZ9rIzHxAENENfgExUYDjw/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Stages
