#### Pricing Models
* My terminology
* A subset of the business model
* Explanation of who pays and what they pay for
* Ask yourself some questions:
	* Who is getting value out of this business?
	* Who is willing to pay for that value?
	* What exactly are they willing to pay for?
	* When are they most likely to be willing to pay for it?
	* How often are they willing to pay for it?

##### Discussion about "our" products

* Each team come up with at last TWO distinct pricing models for your product.
* Take 15 minutes. Consider:
	* Will the model "make sense" to the buyer?
	* Will they be willing to pay it?
	* Is the pricing anchored with any other prices or expectations?
* Present them to class

##### Freemium as a pricing model
* (play on words with "Premium")
* Base product is free
* Has some limitations
* Pay for "full product"
* Tiers of "full product"

#### Pricing
* Pricing as a hypothesis
* How to test
  * “What would you pay for this?”
  * “Would you buy this for $20?”
  * “How much do you think this is worth?”
  * “What’s the most you’d pay?”

* How it fits into the financial model

#### Discussion about this course
* Take 5 minutes to think and write down some notes
* A friend asks if he/she should take this course. Would you recommend it? What would you say students need to do if they want to do well in the course?
* If you were to take this course again, would you do anything differently? What and why?
* What's the relationship between natural ability and hard work? Can you still learn things for which you don’t think you have much natural ability? Can hard work overcome natural ability deficits?
