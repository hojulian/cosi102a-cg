1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Pirate Metrics and Growth Hacking:** Growth Hacking is a 'new profession'. The function is to develop analytical tools and techniques, and a methodology to connect spending on growth with actual results. It's closely related to 'pirate metrics' which is a funny expression cointed to describe a very effective approach. The goal of this work is to introduce you to the fundamental ideas and proponents of it, and ask you to think critically about how these techniques might come into play for your projects:
    * Read the attached PDF of a blog post: <a href="../growthhacking.pdf">Growth Hacking</a>.
    * View this five-minute video by [Dave McClure on "Pirate Metrics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjgfW0BIrw), so you understand one of the key ways we measure the components of success: "Startup Metrics for Pirates".
    * Read and understand what is meant by Growth Hacking. There are lots of sources on the web. Here are two: [The Rise of the Growth Hacker](http://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/).
    * <%= deliverable "Refering to those articles or any other source, how could Growth Hacking apply to your team's product?" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> Read and understand [Cohort Analysis](http://practicetrumpstheory.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics/). <%= deliverable "Explain AND SHOW how cohort analysis might apply to your team's project. You can answer this with a google spreadsheet or a note or both." %>
