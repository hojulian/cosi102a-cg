1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Pirate Metrics and Growth Hacking:** Growth Hacking is a 'new profession'. The function is to develop analytical tools and techniques, and a methodology to connect spending on growth with actual results. It's closely related to 'pirate metrics' which is a funny expression cointed to describe a very effective approach. The goal of this work is to introduce you to the fundamental ideas and proponents of it, and ask you to think critically about how these techniques might come into play for your projects:
    * Read the attached PDF of a blog post: <a href="../growthhacking.pdf">Growth Hacking</a>.
    * View this five-minute video by [Dave McClure on "Pirate Metrics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjgfW0BIrw), so you understand one of the key ways we measure the components of success: "Startup Metrics for Pirates".
    * Read and understand what is meant by Growth Hacking. There are lots of sources on the web. Here are two: [The Rise of the Growth Hacker](http://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/).

    <%= deliverable "This is not obvious: it will require thinking and clear writing. Using the articles or any other source, please explain how Growth Hacking might apply to your team's product" %>
1. <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Think and write one-two sentence answers to these three questions with respect to your product. I would like this to be the result of a real discussion among the team members who should be prepared to present them in class. Here are the questions:
    1. What “problem” are you solving? (in 15 secs or less)
    1. Whose “problem” are you solving? (describe your target user with fewer than 6 attributes)
    1. How are you going to prove whether you are solving this problem for those people? (what “single” thing should or would you do to demonnstrate this, say over the next 6-9 months?)
    
    <%= team_deliverable "Your answers to the three questions" %>

3. <%= teambadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

##### Continuing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 13. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.

##### Interesting, but not mandatory reading
1. **Pirate Metrics** The seminal "Pirate Metrics" presentation by Dave McClure. [Video of Pirate Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-fiwdlxAs), and the corresponding slide deck: [Startup Metrics for Pirates](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).


### Speaker: Jeffrey Beir

We are lucky today to have Jeffrey Beir lead the discussion. His greatest claim to fame (ahem) is that he and I together founded [eRoom Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERoom) way back in the previous millenium. Jeffrey was my boss and the CEO. Before that he was a top executive at [Lotus Development Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software), where we first met. After eRoom he went on the being a successful Venture Capitalist. Jeffrey and I are still good friends.

  * Revenue - users conduct some monetization action
* What are users?
* What about two or three sided markets?
* Conversion: Getting a specific user from one to the next stage
* See: [Example Converstion Metrics](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/1HCOLcjFBO5sjhuwd1iICwGZ9rIzHxAENENfgExUYDjw/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Stages
