    * Which "Pirate Metrics" lever (AARRR) do you think would be most important in growing your product?
    * Can you think of one or two growth experiments you'd recommend?
1. Read and understand [Cohort Analysis](http://practicetrumpstheory.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics/). <%= deliverable "Explain how cohort analysis might apply to your team's project. You can answer this with a google spreadsheet or a note or both." %>
