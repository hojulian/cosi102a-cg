1.  <%= pdfbadge %> An entrepreneur has to learn to think strategically, analytically and carefully when evaluating what to do, how to do it, and what to do next. Read [Delivery Startups are Back like it's 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html). Think about the idea of a delivery startup on campus. What might be some of the advantages of targeting college students? What are characteristics of them as a customer base which would make it hard for a fedex or amazon to deliver to them? What are some of their needs which might be different and hard to meet by a general business? How would you test some of these questions and assumptions? What kinds of products might be amenable? Is there room to capitalize on the slowness of the mailroom? What products, services, customers, campuses, geographies, and any other characteristics might be relevant? Is this a worthwhile idea to pursue? <%= deliverable "Brief thoughts on these articles and musings about the questions that are posed and what it brings to mind." %>

#### Pricing Models
* My terminology
* A subset of the business model
* Explanation of who pays and what they pay for
* Ask yourself some questions:
	* Who is getting value out of this business?
	* Who is willing to pay for that value?
	* What exactly are they willing to pay for?
	* When are they most likely to be willing to pay for it?
	* How often are they willing to pay for it?

##### Discussion about "our" products

* Each team come up with at last TWO distinct pricing models for your product.
* Take 15 minutes. Consider:
	* Will the model "make sense" to the buyer?
	* Will they be willing to pay it?
	* Is the pricing anchored with any other prices or expectations?
* Present them to class

##### Freemium as a pricing model
* (play on words with "Premium")
* Base product is free
* Has some limitations
* Pay for "full product"
* Tiers of "full product"

#### Pricing
* Pricing as a hypothesis
* How to test
  * “What would you pay for this?”
  * “Would you buy this for $20?”
  * “How much do you think this is worth?”
  * “What’s the most you’d pay?”

* How it fits into the financial model

#### Discussion about this course
* Take 5 minutes to think and write down some notes
* A friend asks if he/she should take this course. Would you recommend it? What would you say students need to do if they want to do well in the course?
* If you were to take this course again, would you do anything differently? What and why?
* What's the relationship between natural ability and hard work? Can you still learn things for which you don’t think you have much natural ability? Can hard work overcome natural ability deficits?

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
