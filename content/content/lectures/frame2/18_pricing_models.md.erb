#### Pricing Models
* My terminology
* A subset of the business model
* Explanation of who pays and what they pay for
* Ask yourself some questions:
	* Who is getting value out of this business?
	* Who is willing to pay for that value?
	* What exactly are they willing to pay for?
	* When are they most likely to be willing to pay for it?
	* How often are they willing to pay for it?
  * Is your pricing model "logical" or "reasonable"?

<%= include_topic :pricing_model_exercise %>

#### Pricing
* Pricing as a hypothesis
* How to test
  * “What would you pay for this?”
  * “Would you buy this for $20?”
  * “How much do you think this is worth?”
  * “What’s the most you’d pay?”

##### Freemium vs. Free Trial
  * Play on words with "Premium" and "Free"
  * Freemium:
    * Base product is free
    * Has some limitations
    * Pay for "full product"
    * Tiers of "full product"
  * Contrast with "free trial":
    * Full product
    * Can use it only for limited time (e.g. 1 week)
<%= discussion_box "When is freemium more or less appropriate than free trial?" %>

#### Discussion about "our" products

* Each team come up with at last TWO distinct pricing models for your product.
* Take 15 minutes. Consider:
	* Will the model "make sense" to the buyer?
	* Will they be willing to pay it?
	* Is the pricing anchored with any other prices or expectations?
* Present them to class
* How it fits into the financial model

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
