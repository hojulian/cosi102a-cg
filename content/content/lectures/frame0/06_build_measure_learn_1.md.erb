1. **Read:** <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>Read Chapter 7 of "Lean Startup". This chapter begins the justification and explanation of the importance of measurement. Here are some warmup questions:
    * The chapter talks a lot about "the engine of growth". Explain the concept in one paragraph so that someone who is not familiar with Lean Startup could understand it.
    * What is Lazy Registration? Describe the reason why Grockit implemented it originally, how they tested its effectiveness and what they concluded about Lazy Registration at Grockit.
    * Thinking about your pilot project, what would an example be of a "vanity" metric and what of an "actionable" metric? In what way is that  vanity metric?
    * Checkin: What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Write a short document with your responses. pdf. latte." %>
1. **Term Project Brainstorm:** Everyone meet with 1 or at most 2 other students. Feel free to post to the Latte class forum if you're looking for a partner. Spend 2 hours being very creative about thinking up new products. Here are tips about choosing a product: <%= link_to_topic :choose_product %>. Each student's "deliverable" is to write up one new product on the [Product Idea List](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=597311).
1. **Term Project Feedbacks:** Review the [Product Ideas List](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=597311). Read or scan all the other ideas. Each student's "deliverable" is to add a comment to two different projects proposed by others, with new ideas, questions, and +1's as you feel apprpriate.
