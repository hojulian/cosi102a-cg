1.  <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Read: "Lean Startup Chapter 6". Think about the following warmup questions as you read the chapter:
    * Sometimes customers get a product that's imperfect, incomplete. When might this happen? . Is that a good or bad thing? What's the purpose for doing this?
    * It's been said (by me among others) that an MVP is neither minimum, viable nor a product. Can you explain why that might be a valid statement, or not?
    * How can you do an MVP of a hardware product? After all, a hardware product by definition has to be manufactured and that is never cheap.
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your responses to the warmup questions as a pdf in Latte" %>
1. Each Pilot team (all members) meet outside of class for at least 1 hour again,  outside class. Continue working on your Pilot Project Report. Discuss and capture hypotheses for your version of the product. In addition to a hypothesis, consider how you could test it. Update your report.
1. <%= partbadge %> Term Project: Write up at least one product idea that you MIGHT want to work on and submit a description to the [List of Term Project Ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=597311). You can use any idea, from brainstorming so far, from your own discussions, or from anywhere at all. <%= deliverable "Submit your idea and add it to the list. Read through all the others, and post a couple of questions, comments and +1's." %>

#### Interesting (optional) reading
* The term MVP was defined (for this specific context) several years ago by Eric Ries. It has always been a bit of a problem because people starting "misusing" it, to mean, "beta" or "early release". Another book i really like has their own refinement of the term: [What's an MVP?](http://ask.leanstack.com/lean-startup-fundamentals/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp)
* This [MVP Guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) has a good video if you want to review things from a different angle. It's by Eric Ries himself.

#### Discussion
* Discussion of Chapter 6, what's an MVP, why do we need one.
* Each Pilot team gives an update of where they are at
#### Some tips about choosing a successful Product

####  Term Projects Brainstorm

Towards the end of September, we will begin working on the term projects. Between now and then we will be coming up with ideas, writing them up, etc.

<%= callout("right now", " Second round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down.") %>

* Review and reference: <%= link_to_topic :hypotheses %>
* Review and reference: <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* Lets discuss your hypotheses, experiments, discuss MVPs. Teams, what will you do between now and next class to get out of the building? What are some quick ways to get quick feedback?" %>
* Let's talk over students' ideas so far for term products.

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
