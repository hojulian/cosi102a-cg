1. **Pilot Teams:** Pilot teams: Contuinue working on your Pilot Project and the report. Invest at least 90 minutes, partially as a team and partially doing "out of the building" work. Review <%= link_to_topic :pilot_project %>, specifically the section about "team deliverables." Review and update your plans with new or refined hypotheses. Prioritize which ones to test next and formulate the MVP or experiment. Assign one or two to test by each team member. Refine and agree on what you think the product will actually do. Actually try and validate them by getting out of the building. Keep notes. <%= team_deliverable "Update pilot project report with notes, hypotheses, vision in your Pilot Project Report draft, and prepare to talk informally about out of the building experiences." %>

#### Guest Lecturer: Michael Skok

Our first speaker of the semester is Michael Skok. As an entrepreneur-turned-venture capitalist, Michael loves collaborating with young entrepreneurs, helping them explore their value propositions. However, many entrepreneurs lose out, due to never truly articulating a compelling value proposition. Establishing a substantive value proposition is critical if you want to start the journey from your “idea” to building a successful company.
