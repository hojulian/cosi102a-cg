####  Talk about Term Projects

Here are some examples of previous projects

* [Brandeis Computer Science Projects](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/)

In week 5 we will begin working on the term projects. Between now and then we will be coming up with ideas, writing them up, etc. We will be adding them to the [Latte assignment number 4.4](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055). Let's take a quick look.

<%= callout("Start thinking!", " Every student will have to create at least one idea for a term project. As we brainstorm about product ideas you can start collecting the ones that you like and want to put forward as your idea for a term project. Right now: First round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down.") %>
