1. Pilot teams meet outside of class for at least 1 hour, and discuss project, and begin drafting their Pilot Project Report (see <%= link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>). Do this as a shared Google doc. Make that document publically available. Update this [Latte Wiki Page](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/wiki/view.php?id=597313) with the names of the pilot team members, and a link to the draft of your report. <%= team_deliverable "Updated Latte Wiki Page as stated." %>

####  Talk about Term Projects

* In week 5 we will begin working on the term projects
* Between now and then we will be coming up with ideas, writing them up, etc.
* Here is a page with <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %>
* Discuss how it should work: <%= link_to_section :welcome, :term_project_outline %>

#### Brainstorm!
* Every student will have to create at least one idea for a term project.
* As we brainstorm about product ideas you can start collecting the ones that you like and want to put forward as your idea for a term project.

<%= callout("Right now", " First round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down.") %>
