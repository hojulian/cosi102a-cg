1. **Read:** <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> Read Chapter 7 of "Lean Startup". This chapter begins the justification and explanation of the importance of measurement. Here are some warmup questions:
  * The chapter talks a lot about "the engine of growth". Explain the concept in one paragraph so that someone who is not familiar with Lean Startup could understand it.
  * What is Lazy Registration? Describe the reason why Grockit implemented it originally, how they tested its effectiveness and what they concluded about Lazy Registration at Grockit.
  * Thinking about your pilot project, what would an example be of a "vanity" metric and what of an "actionable" metric? In what way is that  vanity metric?
  * Checkin: What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
  * <%= deliverable "Complete warmup quiz in Latte." %>
1. **Pilot Teams:** <%= partbadge %> Pilot teams: Invest at least 90 minutes, partially as a team and partially doing "out of the building" work. Review <%= link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>, specifically the section about "team deliverables." Review and update your plans with new or refined hypotheses. Prioritize which ones to test next and formulate the MVP or experiment. Assign one or two to test by each team member. Refine and agree on what you think the product will actually do. Actually try and validate them by getting out of the building. Keep notes. <%= team_deliverable "Pilot Project Report, draft 3: Update notes, hypotheses, vision in your Pilot Project Report draft, and prepare to talk informally about out of the building experiences." %>
1. **Term Project Brainstorm:** Everyone meet with 1 or at most 2 other students. Feel free to post to the Latte class forum if you're looking for a partner. Spend 2 hours being very creative about thinking up new products. Here are tips about choosing a product: <%= link_to_topic :choose_product %>. Each student's "deliverable" is to write up one new product on the [product list](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055).
1. **Term Project Feedbacks:** Review the [product list](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=405055). Read or scan all the other ideas. Each student's "deliverable" is to add a comment to two different projects proposed by others, either adding ideas, and seperately indicating with a +1 two other ideas that they think they could work on it.

#### Homework Discussion
* Each team tell the class some of your out of the building experiences

#### Metrics
<%= include_topic :metrics_intro %>

#### Term Projects
* <%= discussion "About possible term projects" %>
	* Go through all the proposals for a quick critique.
	* Review lists of products for part two of the course.
	* See which ones look good. Start thinking about which one you want to be part of!

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
