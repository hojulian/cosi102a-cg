<%= homework_hdr %>
1. <%= timebadge %> <%= partbadge %> Read [How to start a startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/) (or watch the video, but if you do, don't miss the transcript comments). <%= deliverable "Do the warmup quiz in Latte"%>
1. **Pilot Teams:** <%= partbadge %> Pilot teams: Invest at least 90 minutes, partially as a team and partially doing "out of the building" work. Review <%= link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>, specifically the section about "team deliverables." Review and update your plans with new or refined hypotheses. Prioritize which ones to test next and formulate the MVP or experiment. Assign one or two to test by each team member. Refine and agree on what you think the product will actually do. Actually try and validate them by getting out of the building. Keep notes. <%= team_deliverable "Update pilot project report with notes, hypotheses, vision in your Pilot Project Report draft, and prepare to talk informally about out of the building experiences." %>

Our speaker today is Andy Payne. You can find [information about Andy on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acpayne/). You might ask him to link to you on linkedIn as well. While he denies that this is article, here's a very intersting [list of the top boston area Angels](http://blog.jonpierce.com/post/520863618/bostons-best-angel-investors).

Andy will explore questions like: "Who is an entrepreneur?", "Should I start a startup?", "How can I tell if I have the right makeup to be an entrepreneur?", "How do I learn what I need to know", etc.
