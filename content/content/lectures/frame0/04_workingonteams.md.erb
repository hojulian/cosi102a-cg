<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Monkey**: Read the article <a href=" http://resources.library.brandeis.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&sw=w&u=mlin_m_brandeis&v=2.1&id=GALE%7CA57484465&it=r&asid=befacd0724dc4ad12c4041edf0ee9288.">"Management Time: Who's got the monkey"</a>. It's a classic from the Harvard Business Review, they say the most purchased reprint. (By the way, with a little bit of googling you can find a prettier pdf of this article.) This article is a classic of personal and team effectiveness. Think about it and your gut reaction to it. Do you understand it from your own experience? Have you tried to put the monkey on someone else? Has a peer or manager or professor tried to put a monkey on your back. Do you think the perspective of this article is constructive or manipulative? <%= deliverable "Submit your response." %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %>  **Working in Teams** Read the "Working In Teams" section, right below this. Last time I got feedback from the teams that they would have liked more help in being effective as a team. I would like your personal feedback on what I wrote. Is this all common sense? Have you already had lots of experience working in teams? Did you see anything that you really disagreed with? Name one or two things that you would like to learn more about, didn't understand, or found particularly interesting. Are you prepared to use these techniques? <%= deliverable "Brief response to the writeup addressing these or other questions." %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Review**: Look at this cool site: [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses). Poke around it and read 3 projects that interest you. I would like you to tell me what 3 you picked, give a one or two sentence summary of what the product is, and tell me one idea you got from reading it that you might be able to use. <%= deliverable "Write up answering those questions." %>
