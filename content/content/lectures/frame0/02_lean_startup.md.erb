#### Discussion

#### Pilot Project
* <%= link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>
* Teams are determined. 5 students per. Term project will re-shuffle. Please sit together!
* Be ambitious (but not unrealistic). Consider a "match making" service or a "marketplace". Consider interesting/unique UI ideas. Consider a message-stream.
* You may play with and or extend the idea. Pivots from basic vision are perfectly fine!
