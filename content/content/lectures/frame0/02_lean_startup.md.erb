1. <%= timebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> Study "The Lean Startup", Chapters 1, 2 and 3. As you read please think about the following warmup questions:
    * Ries has a particular definition of a startup. What conditions must be true for him to consider a project within an established company to be a “startup”?
    * What kinds of uncertainty and risk does a startup encounter?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!

    * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these warmup questions in Latte, as a pdf" %>. Warmup questions are always graded as "participation only" (<%= partbadge %>), are due by 8am of the day of class (<%= timebadge %>) in the form of a pdf, with your name and homework number in the header (<%= pdfbadge %>)

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Read: [Inventor who gave his idea away](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20130412/09091522689/heres-another-inventor-who-willingly-gave-his-greatest-idea-away-order-to-establish-it-as-global-standard.shtml) and [Students Inventing Programs to Streamline Their Colleges](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0). <%= deliverable "Write a brief reflection, responding to one of these two articles -- thoughts, disagreements, reflections"  %>

#### Pilot Project
* <%= link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>
* Teams are determined. 5 students per. Term project will re-shuffle. Please sit together!
* Be ambitious (but not unrealistic). Consider a "match making" service or a "marketplace". Consider interesting/unique UI ideas. Consider a message-stream.
* You may play with and or extend the idea. Pivots from basic vision are perfectly fine!
* <%= discussion "Let's practice. Some hypotheses for Student Buying Club?" %>
