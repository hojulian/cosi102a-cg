1. <%= timebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> Study "The Lean Startup", Chapters 1, 2 and 3. As you read please think about the following warmup questions:
    * Ries has a particular definition of a startup. What conditions must be true for him to consider a project within an established company to be a “startup”?
    * What kinds of uncertainty and risk does a startup encounter?
    * What was the crux of the original IMVU product vision?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these warmup questions in Latte, as a pdf" %>. Warmup questions are always graded as "participation only" (<%= partbadge %>), are due by 10am of the day of class (<%= timebadge %>) in the form of a pdf, with your name and homework number in the header (<%= pdfbadge %>)
