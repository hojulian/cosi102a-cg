1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Term Project Ideation:** Continuing today's process, Work with one other student to develop a product idea further. **[Here's the list from today:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSHzvyeIp9hIP1zPWa0jjGqpes4kw9GEkLeDcgF48Xs/edit?usp=sharing)** **You** choose a single partner and spend 1+ hours talking and writing. Your write up should not be longer than 1 page. Each student of the pair will submit the same pdf and will get the same mark for the writeup. Your writeup should include a product name, one line summary of product and a longer description, including  major features, the key problem it solves or pain that it addresses; who the product is meant for and why you think it's cool. <%= deliverable "More detailed write up of your favorite (so far) term product idea" %>. **NOTE:** This does not need to be your eventual term project nor does the student have to be an eventual teammate.

##### Ongoing Work
