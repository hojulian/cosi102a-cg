1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Final Pilot Report**: Review and finalize your Pilot Project Report with new or refined hypotheses. I'd like to see meaningful set of hypotheses. Identify your leap of faith hypotheses if possible. Try to get each of the other kinds of hypotheses.

    Here are some (useful and less useful) questions that you can think about: Who is the customer? Where can you find one? Where do they hang out? Do they have this problem? What products or services would work best? Does it make sense to limit it to a college? How often should deals be posted or updated? Should students be able to propose deals? Do they want an email alert or an app? Do they want to use messaging? Does the merchant want to collect information abou the customers?

    Try to validate as much as possible outside the building. You can use surveys, but also personal meetings, emails, facebook, searching through newsgroups and any of the other techniques we've discussed.

    Look at deliverables defined here: <%=link_to_section :welcome, :pilot_project %>. <%= team_deliverable ("Finalized pilot project Report, as pdf") %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **PILOT project team and self assessment**: Write a brief *self* and *peer* assessment based on your experience in Pilot Project. Briefly say something about each team member, by name, including yourself. It will be kept fully confidential. For example, consider:
    * Does the person contribute personally to their team?
    * How many out-of-class team meetings did this person miss?
    * Is the person a positive influence on productivity?
    * Is the person a reliable team member?
    * Do team mates like working with the person?
    * Is the person at the center of problems or of solutions?
    * Comment on the person in the context of the <%= link_to_topic :asiseemyself %>
