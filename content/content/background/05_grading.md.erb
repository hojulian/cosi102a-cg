#### General

<%= include_topic :general_grading %>

#### Components

* **Class Participation: ~10%:** Do you show up on time (or let the teachers know ahead of time if you cannot?) Do you ask good questions, and contribute to the discussion? Do you keep up with hmework? Do you make a good faith effort at responding to all “Participation Only” work? Many times there is a warmup exercise for a reading. Those are only graded based on participation never for correctness. They have to be submitted in the morning of the day of class to even be considered.

* **Team Contribution (based on peer and self assessments) ~5%:** Do you contribute personally to your team? Are you a positive influence on productivity? Are you a reliable team member? Do your team mates like working with you? Are you at the center of problems or of solutions?

* **Individual Assignments: ~35%:** I will pay attention to whether you are just regurgitating the reading or really engaging with it. So, give a personal perspective or insight, make connections with other readings, your other classes, your own reading and research. Have an interesting point of view. Pay attention to writing good, professional English. Use the tools. Many students find that they benefit from using the Brandeis Writing Center to review first drafts.

* **Team Deliverables: ~25%:** Applies both to work on Pilot and Term project teams. How well are the Lean Startup principles understood, documented and applied? Is the result based truly on hypotheses that are tested, getting out of the building, iterating, and getting true and challenging validations? How much did team members engage in the project?

* **Final Term Project Deliverables: ~25%**: How compelling is the final case? Is it based on real evidence? Does the team explain and persuade in their presentation? How interesting is the product? What is the quality of writing, organization, clarity, fit and finish of a the final deliverables?

#### Extra Credit

<%= callout("IMPORTANT", " The deadline for requesting approval for a extra credit assignment is 2 weeks before the last day of class. For example, if you ask to do an extra credit assignment 1 week before the end of the term, I will not approve. If you do an extra credit assignment without approval, it will not be graded and will not count. Note: it's easier to push your grade up by doing well on the core assignments. An excellent job here will bump your grade at most one step (e.g. B+ -> A-)") %>

##### Ideas for extra credit project
* Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign for your term project. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required.
* Think about an activity that you are seriously passionate about... It might be a cause, a performing art, some scientific endeavor, a hobby. Consider how exactly you would apply the Lean Startup methodology to increasing your impact and success in that arena.
* Investigate by reading scholarly papers, or books, or other online resources about entrepreneurship. Some might support others might contradict the philosophies to the Lean Startup. Write an analysis of the conflict and give your own views of whether the conflict is real and serious, and where you come out on it yourself.
