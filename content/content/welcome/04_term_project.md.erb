title: Term Project
---
#### Purpose

The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* Think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* Develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point
* Refine and distil the results into a great presentation.

#### Teams

We will work in teams of 3-4 students. Each team, by the end of the term, will have defined a new product or service, at least up to a point of being ready to seek funding. The content of the classroom work should be directly applicable to the project work. The high level objectives for each team are:

* Work as a team where everyone contributes. Figure out how you will be effective and make decisions.
* Describe and flesh out an actual product or service that you want to build.
* Follow a lean startup methodology to refine and test and describe the product in detail.
* Articulate and build your MVPs, pivot as needed
* Get out of the building and talk to real users and customers
* Capture learnings along all the dimensions of the business model.
* Prepare for a solid presentation of the product by the end of the semester

#### Product Choices
The team has to come up with a validated business model for a product or service with the following characteristics:

* It should solve a problem we believe (and can show) people really have
* We have evidence that people would pay money to solve it
* Our solution involves technology of some sort
* We should have reason to believe that the product can be built
* Guidelines and questions to ask when <%= link_to_topic :choose_product %>

#### Final Presentations and Deliverables
* At the very end of the semster we will have "Showcase Day"
* Each team will do a formal presentation about their product and project
* There will also be a series of final deliverabes
