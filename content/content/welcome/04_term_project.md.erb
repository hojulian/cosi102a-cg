title: Term Project
---
#### Learning Objectives

The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* Think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* Develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point
* Refine and distill the results into a great presentation.

#### Objective and measures of success

1. **Teamwork:** Work as a team where everyone contributes. Figure out how you will be effective and make decisions.
1. **Invent**: Come up with a new ("technological") product or service, or an adaptation of some other product. It can be something never heard of before, or a refinement or variation, or combination of existing ideas or products.
1. **Validat:e** Subject it to a complete validation, using Lean Startup, iterating on the different aspects, pivoting as necessary. Build MVPs, go out of the building, and produce real evidence.
1. **Prove:** with data from your research and out-of-the-building work, that you have a reasonable belief that it will lead to a profitable business. Iteratte back to 1 if necessary!
1. **Report:** Describe product or business fully, including the design, features, target market, pricing model, revenue sources, and more.

#### Teams

We will work in teams of 4 students. Each team, by the end of the term, will have defined a new product or service, at least up to a point of being ready to seek funding. The content of the classroom work should be directly applicable to the project work.

<%= callout("Note", " It this class we will design, mockup, test and  measure, but not actually implement the new product.") %>

#### Product Choices
The team has to come up with a validated business model for a product or service with the following characteristics:

* It should solve a problem we believe (and can show) people really have
* We have evidence that people would pay money to solve it
* Our solution involves technology of some sort
* We should have reason to believe that the product can be built
* Guidelines and questions to ask when <%= link_to_topic :choose_product %>

#### Final Presentations and Deliverables
* At the very end of the semster we will have "Showcase Day"
* Each team will do a formal presentation about their product and project
* There will also be a series of final deliverabes
