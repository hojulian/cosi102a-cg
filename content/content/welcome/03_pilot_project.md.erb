#### Vision

<%= include_topic :warmup_magic_travel %>

#### Process
For the first 4 weeks of the course we will focused on the "Lean Startup" approach to validating a vision for a project, pivoting as necessary to achieve a product-market fit. We will divide students into groups of 5 or so, and each group will work independently to use the process on the vision for a product described below.

1. Class is divided into 5-student teams. You are a study group. You will work together to understand the ideas of Lean Startup and apply them to the Pilot Project.

1. During the first 4 weeks we will rapidly cover the Lean Startup approach and concepts. In that time you will read about half the book.

1. Each pilot team is required to meet at least 2 hours per week outside of class as a study group to learn from each other and work on group homeworks.

1. The pilot project will end with a class when each of the teams present their deliverables for the pilot project.
