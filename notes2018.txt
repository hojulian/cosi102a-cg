#### Notes for this year
* Consider adding Lean Startup Case Study
* Add page count max on pilot, stage 1, 2 and final deliverables (15?) and make sure there is a rubric. This year we had a bit of a problem  because some of the TAs were over zealous on their grading and this led to some teams going nuts on the details they had for the interim reports
