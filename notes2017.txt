### How to improve the 2017 edition of the course

* Have some kind of social introduction cocktail party section early on.
* Just 30 minutes of mingling. Give them specific things to find out about each other
* Work hard to have an interactive section in every lecture
* Having the lemonade stand exercise followed by the teams discussing their pricing models worked well
* Make sure the TA partners are assigned early on and that they know they have to check in weekly with their teams.

### Positioning

* Exactly what is lean startup
* Kind of a hackathon/case cometition that goes a whole semester
* Does not require Cosi
* Officially cross referenced with Business
