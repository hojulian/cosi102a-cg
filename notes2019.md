* We used a new method for choosing teams:
  * After brainstorming and pitching, ask all students to use an online form to pick their first and second choices.
  * In retrospect it was not ideal
  * Students would only see what team they were on after all the choices were made which was a bit shocking
  * 2/3 of the students got their first choices
  * A few students were bent out of shape because they were not in their first choice
  * Also many misunderstood the process and thought that because they "pitched" the project they would automatically be on those teams.
