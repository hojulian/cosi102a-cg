#### Feedback from class on last day (Fall 2014)
* Spend more time on business model
* Move growth hacking and cohorts earlier
* A little more time on client and server product architecture to give it more of a COSI feel
* Have more case studies like NEST etc.
* PTP Tours was about the right length (some people wanted more, some less)
* Book was good, but the examples are dated.

#### My own thoughts
* At the very beginning maybe spend a little more time explaining why this is Software entrepreneurship even though it seems like mostly general content about entrepreneurship
* Add more weight to creating a landing page and getting feedback from people beyond your own network. How to drive traffic and so on.

* Add a lecture about doing good presentations? Or add more live practice presentations? Or discover a workshop for presentations
* Instead of a handout, have students develop a one page google site to describe their project for eternity.
